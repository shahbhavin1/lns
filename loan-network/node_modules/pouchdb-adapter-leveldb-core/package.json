  "readme": "pouchdb-adapter-leveldb-core ![semver non-compliant](https://img.shields.io/badge/semver-non--compliant-red.svg)\n======\n\nUnderlying adapter code for LevelDOWN-based PouchDB adapters (such as `pouchdb-adapter-leveldb`). Most likely you should not use this package unless you are trying to build your own PouchDB adapter based on a *DOWN database.\n\n### Usage\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-exact pouchdb-adapter-leveldb-core\n```\n\n### Overview\n\n`pouchdb-adapter-leveldb-core` is designed in such a way that you can substitute\n[any LevelDOWN-based implementation](https://github.com/rvagg/node-levelup/wiki/Modules#storage-back-ends) and therefore\nuse PouchDB over RiakDOWN, RedisDOWN, etc.\n\nIn practice, though, only a handful of LevelDOWN-based adapters are supported by PouchDB and guaranteed to run with 100%\nfidelity. Furthermore, adapters like RiakDOWN, MySQLDown, RedisDOWN, etc. rarely provide the feature that fans of those\ndatabases hope to get out of them, i.e. PouchDB's magical syncing capabilities on top of their favorite database. In truth,\nwhat those adapters do is reduce the underlying database to a LevelDB-like key-value store and require PouchDB to implement\nits own revision-handling on top of them. In other words, they tend to be unperformant and require you to exclusively use\nPouchDB's API to access them.\n\nOnly certain adapters (e.g. in-memory, based on [MemDOWN](http://github.com/level/memdown)) are officially supported by the\nPouchDB project; you are free to experiment with other datastores, but be forewarned of the above caveats. To see how to\nbuild a custom LevelDOWN-based database, see the source code for `pouchdb-adapter-memory`, `pouchdb-adapter-localstorage`, or\n`pouchdb-adapter-fruitdown`.\n\n### Details\n\nFor full API documentation and guides on PouchDB, see [PouchDB.com](http://pouchdb.com/). For details on PouchDB sub-packages, see the [Custom Builds documentation](http://pouchdb.com/custom.html).\n\n### Warning: semver-free zone!\n\nThis package is conceptually an internal API used by PouchDB or its plugins. It does not follow semantic versioning (semver), and rather its version is pegged to PouchDB's. Use exact versions when installing, e.g. with `--save-exact`.\n\n### Source\n\nPouchDB and its sub-packages are distributed as a [monorepo](https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/master/doc/design/monorepo.md).\n\nFor a full list of packages, see [the GitHub source](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/tree/master/packages).\n\n\n",
